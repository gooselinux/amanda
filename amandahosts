# Allow access to amanda over the network. See 'man amanda'

# 'ambackup' connects to 'amandad'. If your 'disklist' is correctly
# set up, i.e. if it does not use 'localhost' but the fully qualified
# domain name (FQDN) of the target machine, then you must put
# the FQDN here. 'ambackup' must be run by user 'amandabackup', so we allow
# access by user 'amandabackup'. Do not forget to add an 'only_from' line to
# '/etc/xinet.d/amanda' to allow access to 'amandad' only from known
# IP addresses.

# replace mymachine.mydomain by the correct value and uncomment
# mymachine.mydomain amandabackup


# 'amrecover' connects to 'amandaidx', which uses the fully qualified
# domain name when access is done from another machine. 'amrecover'
# must be run by user 'root', so we allow access by user 'root'.

# replace mymachine.mydomain by the correct value and uncomment
# mymachine.mydomain root


# 'amrecover' connects to 'amandaidx', which uses the bare machine
# name w/o domain name when access is done from the same machine.
# 'amrecover' must be run by user 'root', so we allow access by user
# 'root'.

# replace mymachine by the correct value and uncomment
# mymachine root
