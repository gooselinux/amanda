# This is an example for a crontab entry for automated backup with amanda       
# With these cron lines, Amanda will check that the correct tape is in          
# the drive every weekday afternoon at 4pm (if it isn't, all the                
# operators will get mail).  At 12:45am that night the dumps will be run.       
#
# This should be put in user operator's crontab
